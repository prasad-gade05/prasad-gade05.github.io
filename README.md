# My Portfolio Site

**Live:** https://prasadgade.dev

## Why is this repo named `prasad-gade05.github.io`?

Intentional.

GitHub Pages requires `<username>.github.io` to serve as the **root site** for a custom domain.  
This allows:

- `https://prasadgade.dev` → Portfolio (root)
- `https://prasadgade.dev/<project>` → Other hosted projects

Clean and scalable GitHub Pages architecture.
